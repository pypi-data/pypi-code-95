# Construct Hub

This project maintains a [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) construct library
that can be used to deploy instances of the Construct Hub in any AWS Account.

This software backs the public instance of the
[ConstructHub](https://constructs.dev), and can be used to deploy a self-hosted
instance with personalized configuration.

## :question: Getting Started

> :warning: Disclaimer
>
> The [public instance of ConstructHub](https://constructs.dev) is currently in
> *Developer Preview*.
>
> Self-hosted ConstructHub instances are however in active development and
> should be considered *experimental*. Breaking changes to the public API of
> this package are expected to be released without prior notice, and the
> infrastructure and operational posture of ConstructHub instances may also
> significantly change.
>
> You are welcome to deploy self-hosted instances of ConstructHub for evaluation
> purposes, and we welcome any feedback (good or bad) from your experience in
> doing so.

### Quick Start

Once you have installed the `construct-hub` library in your project, the
simplest way to get started is to create an instance of the `ConstructHub`
construct:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk.core import App, Stack
from construct_hub import ConstructHub

# The usual... you might have used `cdk init app` instead!
app = App()
stack = Stack(app, "StackName")

# Now to business!
ConstructHub(stack, "ConstructHub")
```

### Personalization

#### Using a custom domain name

In order to use a custom domain for your ConstructHub instance instead of the
default CloudFront domain name, specify the `domain` property with the following
elements:

Attribute                     | Description
------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------
`zone`                        | A Route53 Hosted Zone, where DNS records will be added.
`cert`                        | An Amazon Certificate Manager certificate, which must be in the `us-east-1` region.
`monitorCertificateExpiration`| Set to `false` if you do not want an alarm to be created when the certificate is close to expiry.

Your self-hosted ConstructHub instance will be served from the root of the
provided `zone`, so the certificate must match this name.

#### Alternate package sources

By default, ConstructHub has a single package source configured: the public
`npmjs.com` registry. Self-hosted instances typically should list packages from
alternate sources, either in addition to packages from `npmjs.com`, or instead
of those.

The `packageSources` property can be used to replace the default set of package
sources configured on the instance. ConstructHub provides `IPackageSource`
implementations for the public `npmjs.com` registry as well as for private
CodeArtifact repositories:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_codeartifact as codeartifact
from aws_cdk.core import App, Stack
from construct_hub import sources, ConstructHub

# The usual... you might have used `cdk init app` instead!
app = App()
stack = Stack(app, "StackName")

# Now to business!
registry = codeartifact.CfnRegistry(stack, "Registry")
ConstructHub(stack, "ConstructHub",
    package_sources=[
        sources.NpmJs(), # Remove if you do NOT want npmjs.com packages
        sources.CodeArtifact(registry=registry)
    ]
)
```

You may also implement a custom `IPackageSource` if you want to index packages
from alternate locations. In this case, the component you provide will be
responsible for sending notifications to an SQS Queue about newly discovered
packages. You may refer to the [sources.NpmJs](src/package-sources/npmjs.ts) and [sources.CodeArtifact](src/package-sources/code-artifact.ts)
implementations as a reference for hos this can be done.

#### Package deny list

Certain packages may be undesirable to show in your self-hosted ConstructHub
instance. In order to prevent a package from ever being listed in construct hub,
the `denyList` property can be configured with a set of `DenyListRule` objects
that specify which package or package versions should never be lested:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk.core import App, Stack
from construct_hub import ConstructHub

# The usual... you might have used `cdk init app` instead!
app = App()
stack = Stack(app, "StackName")

# Now to business!
ConstructHub(stack, "ConstructHub",
    deny_list=[{"package_name": "sneaky-hackery", "reason": "Mines bitcoins wherever it gets installed"}, {"package_name": "bad-release", "version": "1.2.3", "reason": "CVE-####-#####"}
    ]
)
```

#### Decrease deployment footprint

By default, ConstructHub executes the documentation rendering process in the
context of isolated subnets. This is a defense-in-depth mechanism to mitigate
the risks associated with downloading aribtrary (un-trusted) *npm packages* and
their dependency closures.

This layer of security implies the creation of a number of resources that can
increase the operating cost of your self-hosted instance: several VPC endpoints
are created, an internal CodeArtifact repository needs to be provisioned, etc...

While we generally recommend leaving these features enabled, if your self-hosted
ConstructHub instance only indexes *trusted* packages (as could be the case for
an instance that does not list packages from the public `npmjs.com` registry),
you may set the `isolateLambdas` setting to `false`.

## :gear: Operating a self-hosted instance

1. [Application Overview](./docs/application-overview.md) provides a high-level
   description of the components that make a ConstructHub instance. This is a
   great starting point for people who consider operating a self-hosted instance
   of ConstructHub; and for new operators on-boarding the platform.
2. [Operator Runbook](./docs/operator-runbook.md) is a series of diagnostics and
   troubleshooting guides indended for operators to have a quick and easy way to
   navigate a ConstructHub instance when they are reacting to an alarm or bug
   report.
