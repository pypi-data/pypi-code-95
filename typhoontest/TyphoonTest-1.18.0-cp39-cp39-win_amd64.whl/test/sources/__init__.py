    Parameters
    ----------
    sources: str, list
        Name of the source/sources which represent the grid given as string or list of list of strings
    fault_duration: float, pandas.Timedelta
        Duration of the fault in seconds. It refers
    rms_pu: float, list
        Voltage rms or list of voltage rms per unit values during the fault, based on the prefault value of
        the appropriate voltage source; default value is None and in that case prefault rms values are applied.
    freq_pu: float, list
        Frequency or list of frequency per unit values during the fault, based on the prefault value of the
        appropriate voltage source; default value is None and in that case, prefault frequency values are applied.
    phase_shift: float, list
        Phase shift or list of phase shift values in the moment of the fault; default value is None and in that case
        phase shifts are not applied to voltage sources. The values are given in degrees.
    initial_ramp_duration: float, pandas.Timedelta
        Time needed for the voltage source to get from prefault to fault state
    final_ramp_duration: float, pandas.Timedelta
        Time needed for the voltage source to go back to prefault state from the fault state
    ramp_type: str
        Type of the initial and final ramp. Supported values are ‘lin’ (linear interpolation) and
        ‘exp’ (first order system response - ramp time equals to 7 tau)
    executeAt: float, pandas.Timedelta
        Time moment in which fault is applied. If current simulation time is bigger than fault time, fault is applied
        immediately.
