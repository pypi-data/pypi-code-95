This library provides constructs for Python Lambda functions.

To use this module, you will need to have Docker installed.

## Python Function

Define a `PythonFunction`:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk import aws_lambda as lambda_
from aws_cdk_lib.aws_lambda_python import PythonFunction


PythonFunction(self, "MyFunction",
    entry="/path/to/my/function", # required
    index="my_index.py", # optional, defaults to 'index.py'
    handler="my_exported_func", # optional, defaults to 'handler'
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.PYTHON_3_6
)
```

All other properties of `lambda.Function` are supported, see also the [AWS Lambda construct library](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/tree/master/packages/%40aws-cdk/aws-lambda).

## Module Dependencies

If `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` exists at the entry path, the construct will handle installing
all required modules in a [Lambda compatible Docker container](https://gallery.ecr.aws/sam/build-python3.7)
according to the `runtime`.

Python bundles are only recreated and published when a file in a source directory has changed.
Therefore (and as a general best-practice), it is highly recommended to commit a lockfile with a
list of all transitive dependencies and their exact versions.
This will ensure that when any dependency version is updated, the bundle asset is recreated and uploaded.

To that end, we recommend using [`pipenv`](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html#example-pipfile-lock) or [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control) which has lockfile support.

**Lambda with a requirements.txt**

```plaintext
.
├── lambda_function.py # exports a function named 'handler'
├── requirements.txt # has to be present at the entry path
```

**Lambda with a Pipfile**

```plaintext
.
├── lambda_function.py # exports a function named 'handler'
├── Pipfile # has to be present at the entry path
├── Pipfile.lock # your lock file
```

**Lambda with a poetry.lock**

```plaintext
.
├── lambda_function.py # exports a function named 'handler'
├── pyproject.toml # has to be present at the entry path
├── poetry.lock # your poetry lock file
```

**Lambda Layer Support**

You may create a python-based lambda layer with `PythonLayerVersion`. If `PythonLayerVersion` detects a `requirements.txt`
or `Pipfile` or `poetry.lock` with the associated `pyproject.toml` at the entry path, then `PythonLayerVersion` will include the dependencies inline with your code in the
layer.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
lambda_.PythonFunction(self, "MyFunction",
    entry="/path/to/my/function",
    layers=[
        lambda_.PythonLayerVersion(self, "MyLayer",
            entry="/path/to/my/layer"
        )
    ]
)
```

        '''
        :param scope: -
        :param id: -
        :param entry: (experimental) The path to the root directory of the function.
        :param asset_hash: (experimental) Specify a custom hash for this asset. If ``assetHashType`` is set it must be set to ``AssetHashType.CUSTOM``. For consistency, this custom hash will be SHA256 hashed and encoded as hex. The resulting hash will be the asset hash. NOTE: the hash is used in order to identify a specific revision of the asset, and used for optimizing and caching deployment activities related to this asset such as packaging, uploading to Amazon S3, etc. If you chose to customize the hash, you will need to make sure it is updated every time the asset changes, or otherwise it is possible that some deployments will not be invalidated. Default: - based on ``assetHashType``
        :param asset_hash_type: (experimental) Determines how asset hash is calculated. Assets will get rebuild and uploaded only if their hash has changed. If asset hash is set to ``SOURCE`` (default), then only changes to the source directory will cause the asset to rebuild. This means, for example, that in order to pick up a new dependency version, a change must be made to the source tree. Ideally, this can be implemented by including a dependency lockfile in your source tree or using fixed dependencies. If the asset hash is set to ``OUTPUT``, the hash is calculated after bundling. This means that any change in the output will cause the asset to be invalidated and uploaded. Bear in mind that ``pip`` adds timestamps to dependencies it installs, which implies that in this mode Python bundles will *always* get rebuild and uploaded. Normally this is an anti-pattern since build Default: AssetHashType.SOURCE By default, hash is calculated based on the contents of the source directory. This means that only updates to the source will cause the asset to rebuild.
        :param handler: (experimental) The name of the exported handler in the index file. Default: handler
        :param index: (experimental) The path (relative to entry) to the index file containing the exported handler. Default: index.py
        :param runtime: (experimental) The runtime environment. Only runtimes of the Python family are supported. Default: lambda.Runtime.PYTHON_3_7
        :param allow_all_outbound: (experimental) Whether to allow the Lambda to send all network traffic. If set to false, you must individually add traffic rules to allow the Lambda to connect to network targets. Default: true
        :param allow_public_subnet: (experimental) Lambda Functions in a public subnet can NOT access the internet. Use this property to acknowledge this limitation and still place the function in a public subnet. Default: false
        :param code_signing_config: (experimental) Code signing config associated with this function. Default: - Not Sign the Code
        :param current_version_options: (experimental) Options for the ``lambda.Version`` resource automatically created by the ``fn.currentVersion`` method. Default: - default options as described in ``VersionOptions``
        :param dead_letter_queue: (experimental) The SQS queue to use if DLQ is enabled. Default: - SQS queue with 14 day retention period if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is ``true``
        :param dead_letter_queue_enabled: (experimental) Enabled DLQ. If ``deadLetterQueue`` is undefined, an SQS queue with default options will be defined for your Function. Default: - false unless ``deadLetterQueue`` is set, which implies DLQ is enabled.
        :param description: (experimental) A description of the function. Default: - No description.
        :param environment: (experimental) Key-value pairs that Lambda caches and makes available for your Lambda functions. Use environment variables to apply configuration changes, such as test and production environment configurations, without changing your Lambda function source code. Default: - No environment variables.
        :param environment_encryption: (experimental) The AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt your function's environment variables. Default: - AWS Lambda creates and uses an AWS managed customer master key (CMK).
        :param events: (experimental) Event sources for this function. You can also add event sources using ``addEventSource``. Default: - No event sources.
        :param filesystem: (experimental) The filesystem configuration for the lambda function. Default: - will not mount any filesystem
        :param function_name: (experimental) A name for the function. Default: - AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the function's name. For more information, see Name Type.
        :param initial_policy: (experimental) Initial policy statements to add to the created Lambda Role. You can call ``addToRolePolicy`` to the created lambda to add statements post creation. Default: - No policy statements are added to the created Lambda role.
        :param insights_version: (experimental) Specify the version of CloudWatch Lambda insights to use for monitoring. Default: - No Lambda Insights
        :param layers: (experimental) A list of layers to add to the function's execution environment. You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code during initialization in the form of layers. Layers are packages of libraries or other dependencies that can be used by multiple functions. Default: - No layers.
        :param log_retention: (experimental) The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. Default: logs.RetentionDays.INFINITE
        :param log_retention_retry_options: (experimental) When log retention is specified, a custom resource attempts to create the CloudWatch log group. These options control the retry policy when interacting with CloudWatch APIs. Default: - Default AWS SDK retry options.
        :param log_retention_role: (experimental) The IAM role for the Lambda function associated with the custom resource that sets the retention policy. Default: - A new role is created.
        :param memory_size: (experimental) The amount of memory, in MB, that is allocated to your Lambda function. Lambda uses this value to proportionally allocate the amount of CPU power. For more information, see Resource Model in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Default: 128
        :param profiling: (experimental) Enable profiling. Default: - No profiling.
        :param profiling_group: (experimental) Profiling Group. Default: - A new profiling group will be created if ``profiling`` is set.
        :param reserved_concurrent_executions: (experimental) The maximum of concurrent executions you want to reserve for the function. Default: - No specific limit - account limit.
        :param role: (experimental) Lambda execution role. This is the role that will be assumed by the function upon execution. It controls the permissions that the function will have. The Role must be assumable by the 'lambda.amazonaws.com' service principal. The default Role automatically has permissions granted for Lambda execution. If you provide a Role, you must add the relevant AWS managed policies yourself. The relevant managed policies are "service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" and "service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole". Default: - A unique role will be generated for this lambda function. Both supplied and generated roles can always be changed by calling ``addToRolePolicy``.
        :param security_group: (deprecated) What security group to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. This property is being deprecated, consider using securityGroups instead. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Use securityGroups property instead. Function constructor will throw an error if both are specified. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroups prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param security_groups: (experimental) The list of security groups to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroup prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param timeout: (experimental) The function execution time (in seconds) after which Lambda terminates the function. Because the execution time affects cost, set this value based on the function's expected execution time. Default: Duration.seconds(3)
        :param tracing: (experimental) Enable AWS X-Ray Tracing for Lambda Function. Default: Tracing.Disabled
        :param vpc: (experimental) VPC network to place Lambda network interfaces. Specify this if the Lambda function needs to access resources in a VPC. Default: - Function is not placed within a VPC.
        :param vpc_subnets: (experimental) Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Note: internet access for Lambdas requires a NAT gateway, so picking Public subnets is not allowed. Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified
        :param max_event_age: (experimental) The maximum age of a request that Lambda sends to a function for processing. Minimum: 60 seconds Maximum: 6 hours Default: Duration.hours(6)
        :param on_failure: (experimental) The destination for failed invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param on_success: (experimental) The destination for successful invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param retry_attempts: (experimental) The maximum number of times to retry when the function returns an error. Minimum: 0 Maximum: 2 Default: 2

        :param allow_all_outbound: (experimental) Whether to allow the Lambda to send all network traffic. If set to false, you must individually add traffic rules to allow the Lambda to connect to network targets. Default: true
        :param allow_public_subnet: (experimental) Lambda Functions in a public subnet can NOT access the internet. Use this property to acknowledge this limitation and still place the function in a public subnet. Default: false
        :param code_signing_config: (experimental) Code signing config associated with this function. Default: - Not Sign the Code
        :param current_version_options: (experimental) Options for the ``lambda.Version`` resource automatically created by the ``fn.currentVersion`` method. Default: - default options as described in ``VersionOptions``
        :param dead_letter_queue: (experimental) The SQS queue to use if DLQ is enabled. Default: - SQS queue with 14 day retention period if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is ``true``
        :param dead_letter_queue_enabled: (experimental) Enabled DLQ. If ``deadLetterQueue`` is undefined, an SQS queue with default options will be defined for your Function. Default: - false unless ``deadLetterQueue`` is set, which implies DLQ is enabled.
        :param description: (experimental) A description of the function. Default: - No description.
        :param environment: (experimental) Key-value pairs that Lambda caches and makes available for your Lambda functions. Use environment variables to apply configuration changes, such as test and production environment configurations, without changing your Lambda function source code. Default: - No environment variables.
        :param environment_encryption: (experimental) The AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt your function's environment variables. Default: - AWS Lambda creates and uses an AWS managed customer master key (CMK).
        :param events: (experimental) Event sources for this function. You can also add event sources using ``addEventSource``. Default: - No event sources.
        :param filesystem: (experimental) The filesystem configuration for the lambda function. Default: - will not mount any filesystem
        :param function_name: (experimental) A name for the function. Default: - AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the function's name. For more information, see Name Type.
        :param initial_policy: (experimental) Initial policy statements to add to the created Lambda Role. You can call ``addToRolePolicy`` to the created lambda to add statements post creation. Default: - No policy statements are added to the created Lambda role.
        :param insights_version: (experimental) Specify the version of CloudWatch Lambda insights to use for monitoring. Default: - No Lambda Insights
        :param layers: (experimental) A list of layers to add to the function's execution environment. You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code during initialization in the form of layers. Layers are packages of libraries or other dependencies that can be used by multiple functions. Default: - No layers.
        :param log_retention: (experimental) The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. Default: logs.RetentionDays.INFINITE
        :param log_retention_retry_options: (experimental) When log retention is specified, a custom resource attempts to create the CloudWatch log group. These options control the retry policy when interacting with CloudWatch APIs. Default: - Default AWS SDK retry options.
        :param log_retention_role: (experimental) The IAM role for the Lambda function associated with the custom resource that sets the retention policy. Default: - A new role is created.
        :param memory_size: (experimental) The amount of memory, in MB, that is allocated to your Lambda function. Lambda uses this value to proportionally allocate the amount of CPU power. For more information, see Resource Model in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Default: 128
        :param profiling: (experimental) Enable profiling. Default: - No profiling.
        :param profiling_group: (experimental) Profiling Group. Default: - A new profiling group will be created if ``profiling`` is set.
        :param reserved_concurrent_executions: (experimental) The maximum of concurrent executions you want to reserve for the function. Default: - No specific limit - account limit.
        :param role: (experimental) Lambda execution role. This is the role that will be assumed by the function upon execution. It controls the permissions that the function will have. The Role must be assumable by the 'lambda.amazonaws.com' service principal. The default Role automatically has permissions granted for Lambda execution. If you provide a Role, you must add the relevant AWS managed policies yourself. The relevant managed policies are "service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" and "service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole". Default: - A unique role will be generated for this lambda function. Both supplied and generated roles can always be changed by calling ``addToRolePolicy``.
        :param security_group: (deprecated) What security group to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. This property is being deprecated, consider using securityGroups instead. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Use securityGroups property instead. Function constructor will throw an error if both are specified. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroups prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param security_groups: (experimental) The list of security groups to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroup prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param timeout: (experimental) The function execution time (in seconds) after which Lambda terminates the function. Because the execution time affects cost, set this value based on the function's expected execution time. Default: Duration.seconds(3)
        :param tracing: (experimental) Enable AWS X-Ray Tracing for Lambda Function. Default: Tracing.Disabled
        :param vpc: (experimental) VPC network to place Lambda network interfaces. Specify this if the Lambda function needs to access resources in a VPC. Default: - Function is not placed within a VPC.
        :param vpc_subnets: (experimental) Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Note: internet access for Lambdas requires a NAT gateway, so picking Public subnets is not allowed. Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified
        :param entry: (experimental) The path to the root directory of the function.
        :param asset_hash: (experimental) Specify a custom hash for this asset. If ``assetHashType`` is set it must be set to ``AssetHashType.CUSTOM``. For consistency, this custom hash will be SHA256 hashed and encoded as hex. The resulting hash will be the asset hash. NOTE: the hash is used in order to identify a specific revision of the asset, and used for optimizing and caching deployment activities related to this asset such as packaging, uploading to Amazon S3, etc. If you chose to customize the hash, you will need to make sure it is updated every time the asset changes, or otherwise it is possible that some deployments will not be invalidated. Default: - based on ``assetHashType``
        :param asset_hash_type: (experimental) Determines how asset hash is calculated. Assets will get rebuild and uploaded only if their hash has changed. If asset hash is set to ``SOURCE`` (default), then only changes to the source directory will cause the asset to rebuild. This means, for example, that in order to pick up a new dependency version, a change must be made to the source tree. Ideally, this can be implemented by including a dependency lockfile in your source tree or using fixed dependencies. If the asset hash is set to ``OUTPUT``, the hash is calculated after bundling. This means that any change in the output will cause the asset to be invalidated and uploaded. Bear in mind that ``pip`` adds timestamps to dependencies it installs, which implies that in this mode Python bundles will *always* get rebuild and uploaded. Normally this is an anti-pattern since build Default: AssetHashType.SOURCE By default, hash is calculated based on the contents of the source directory. This means that only updates to the source will cause the asset to rebuild.
        :param handler: (experimental) The name of the exported handler in the index file. Default: handler
        :param index: (experimental) The path (relative to entry) to the index file containing the exported handler. Default: index.py
        :param runtime: (experimental) The runtime environment. Only runtimes of the Python family are supported. Default: lambda.Runtime.PYTHON_3_7
