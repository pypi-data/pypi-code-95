"""
A very simple testing library intended for use by students in an intro
course. Includes capabilities for mocking input and setting up
expectations for the results and/or printed output of arbitrary
expressions.

optimism.py

## Example usage

```py
import optimism as opt

# Simple example function
def f(x, y):
    "Example function"
    return x + y + 1

# Simple test for that function
opt.testCase(f(1, 2)) # line 9
opt.expectResult(4)


# Function that prints multiple lines of output
def display(message):
    print("The message is:")
    print('-' + message + '-')

# One test case with two separate expectations
opt.captureOutput()
opt.testCase(display('hello')) # line 20
opt.expectOutputContains('The message')
opt.expectOutputContains('-hello-')


# A function that uses input
def askName():
    return input("What is your name? ")

opt.provideInput('''
Name
''')
opt.testCase(askName()) # line 32
opt.expectResult('Name')
# Note: output capturing remains active for subsequent tests
# Note: inputs don't show up in captured output
opt.expectOutputContains('What is your name?')
```

If we were to run this example file, we should see the following output
(other output that one would normally expect from the test function
calls is suppressed due to `captureOutput`).

```txt
✓ example.py:10
✓ example.py:21
✓ example.py:22
✓ example.py:33
✓ example.py:35
```

If an expectation is not met, the output would look different. For
example, if our first expectation had been 3 instead of 4, we'd see:

```txt
✗ example.py:10
  Result 4 was different from the expected value 3.
```

## Core functionality

The main functions you'll need are:

- `trace` works like `print`, but shows some extra information, and you
  can use it as part of a larger expression. Use this for figuring out
  what's going wrong when your expectations aren't met.
- `testCase` establishes a test case, and subsequent expectations are
  attached to the most recent test case.
- `expectResult`, `expectOutputContains`, and/or `expectCustom` to
  establish expectations for the result and/or output of the most recent
  test case.
- `captureOutput` sets up output capturing, which is needed if
  `expectOutputContains` will be used. The captured output will saved
  and reset every time a new test case is established, but if printing
  happens between test cases, `resetOutput` may be necessary before the
  next test case. `showOutput` can be used to show the output that's
  being captured instead of suppressing it.
- `provideInput` sets up inputs ahead of time, so that interactive code
  can be tested without pausing for real user input. `restoreInput` can be
  used to resume normal interactive input.
- `runFile` can be used to test a file that's supposed to be run as a
  script, instead of testing individual expressions. Simply call
  `testCase` with `runFile()` as the argument. Testing machinery will be
  disabled during the run.
- `detailLevel` can be called to control the level of detail printed in
  the output.
- `showSummary` can be used to summarize the number of expectations
  which passed or failed.
- `colors` can be used to enable or disable color codes for printed text.
  Disable this if you're getting garbled output.

Note: currently, if test causes an error, you just get the error, and
the testing machinery doesn't do anything about that.

    `expectResult` and other expect functions will be checked in the
    context of the most recently established test case.

        the calls should execute more times than another when that line

        the use of `testCase` multiple times on one line within generator
        or if/else expressions)

        `testCase` should have side effects when evaluated:
        - Attribute accesses
        - Subscripts (including expressions inside brackets)
        - Variable lookups
        (Note that those things don't normally have side effects!)
